As you begin developing solutions for the clients, please keep a broader perspective. Take a step back from your solution, examine it critically, and think about ways to improve it with a better design, broader applicability, more efficient design. How can you continually add value?
For UMGC City projects, think about how to make it easier for not only City of Pasadena, but for other municipalities as well. Think about thousands of municipalities, with millions of citizens, using the software all over the world in different languages. How can you help them?
Use open-source software whenever possible. Make it affordable for them. Make modular components that are easy to install. Make it manageable for them. How can you increase your contribution?
For NASA projects, think about saving precious seconds of astronauts on a space missions. Make the software robust - you don't want a glitch hundreds of miles up there.
Yes, your attention to detail matters. It makes you a more detailed-oriented and careful person. I want you all to put this project on your resume and feel good about it in retrospect. I want your eyes to shine when you talk about it in your next job interview. No role is insignificant - it is the entire team that gets us to our goals. You are important and your role is important for the team mission.
